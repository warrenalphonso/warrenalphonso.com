If you can keep your head when all about you <br />
&emsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br />
&emsp;But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br />
&emsp;Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, <br />
Or being hated, don't give way to hating, <br />
&emsp;And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; <br />

If you can dream &mdash; and not make dreams your master; <br />
&emsp;If you can think &mdash; and not make thoughts your aim; <br />
If you meet with Triumph and Disaster <br />
&emsp;And treat those two imposters just the same; <br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken <br />
&emsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br />
&emsp;And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools; <br />

If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br />
&emsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br />
&emsp;And never breathe a word about your loss; <br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br />
&emsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br />
&emsp;Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!' <br />

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br />
&emsp;Or walk with Kings &mdash; nor lose the common touch, <br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br />
&emsp;If all men count with you, but none too much; <br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br />
&emsp;With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, <br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, <br />
&emsp;And &mdash; which is more &mdash; you'll be a Man, my son! <br />
