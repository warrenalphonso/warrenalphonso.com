You will slack off at life in proportion to how replaceable or interchangeable
you feel. Chosen Ones cut themselves no slack.

For most people, your downtime drifts shape your life course more than your
uptime aspirations. Even elite Olympic athletes. Paying attention to that and
responding to it is something youâ€™ll never regret.

Watch where your mind drifts under slack. It matters more than where it marches
when stressed by heavy discipline. True Chosen Ones have zero drift downtime. 
They kinda just fully rest like the biblical god on the 7th day or something.
But mere mortals drift in revealing ways.
