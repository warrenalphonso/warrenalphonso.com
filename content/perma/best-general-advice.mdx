These are excerpts from William James's 1890 classic, *Principles of Psychology*,
Chapter IV, "Habit":
1. The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous system our 
ally instead of our enemy. It is to fund and capitalize our acquisitions, and 
live at ease upon the interest of the fund. 
2. For this we must make automatic and habitual, as early as possible, as many 
useful actions as we can, and guard against the growing into ways that are 
likely to be disadvantageous to us, as we should guard against the plague. The 
more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody 
of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own 
proper work. 
3. Seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you 
make, and on *every emotional prompting you may experience* in the direction of 
the habits you aspire to gain. It is not in the moment of their forming, but in 
the moment of their producing motor effects, that resolves and aspirations 
communicate the new 'set' to their brain. 
4. No matter how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and not matter how 
good one's sentiments may be, if one have not taken advantage of *every concrete 
opportunity to act, one's character may remain entirely unaffected for the 
better*. 
5. As a final practical maxim, relative to these habits of will, we may, then, 
offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little 
*gratuitious* exercise every day. That is, be systematically ascetic or heroic 
in little unnecessary points, do every day or two something for no other reason 
than that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws 
nigh, it may find you not unnerved.
