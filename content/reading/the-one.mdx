I still don't think I understand what it means to love unconditionally. To do
something regardless of whether the other person reciprocates well or despises
you even more, regardless of whether you think the other person will reciprocate.
To do something purely out of love for the humanity of the other person and
genuinely not expect nor be moved by gratitude or hatred.

I think my meditations on the HPMOR ideal of what makes humanity worth saving
will help me learn unconditional love.

Another idea that rings true is that of real and true confidence. Not confidence
in that I push my shoulders back and place a bored/neutral expression on my
face to look confident and explicitly look for my nervous ticks so I can stop
them. Actual genuine concern for the other person. If they don't want you,
leave. Not out of spite, not to make them coming running back, not to make
them feel bad. But because it's genuinely the best thing for both of us. Not in
some morally upright way, but in a purely practical down-to-earth way.
