When you are deciding something difficult, how do you do it?

There are some common frames you can look at — results-based, financial-outcomes-based, social-outcomes-based, self-reward-based, macro-based, micro-based.

By default, a mix of these forces come together to influence your decision. The problem? These forces suck.

Decisions based on these frames often lead to short-sighted outcomes, and endanger what matters most in life.

So, what can we do? I think all religions, all stoics, all grandmas, point to a form of decision making that guarantees you won’t endanger what matters most.
