# Investigating the Hubbard model with variational algorithms

### A project done through the QC Mentorship program

**Written by Warren Alphonso, advised by Ntwali Bashige.**

Once realized, quantum computers would be an intellectual and engineering
triumph, success in turning Nature's powerful and mysterious laws into
computational power. If our current understanding of quantum mechanics holds up,
it would mean the ability to efficiently simulate _any physical process_.

But it might take decades to build a quantum computer powerful enough to catch
up with classical computers after their 50-year headstart.

A question I've been trying to answer since I started studying quantum computing
concerns its near-term usefulness: <u>what exactly can near-term quantum
computers tell us about the world that our classical physical heuristics
can't</u>? I don't have a great answer yet, but this question is the guiding
principle for the following post.

Most near-term useful work will probably use _variational algorithms_. This
project explores the most well-known of the variational algorithms: the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). We'll use the VQE to analyze a fundamental
model in condensed matter physics, the Hubbard model.

You've noticed the length of this post by now.
It is intentional; I've favored a long, winding, wandering, uncertain path
as the search for uses of a quantum computer. Let's get started! [^1]

[^1]:
    _Note to the prospective reader:_ I've done my best to only assume
    you've read the [four essays at QuantumCountry](https://quantum.country/).

Another thing: I don't know much quantum mechanics, so instead of pretending
like things make sense when I don't understand them, I'll explicitly say
["This is true by magic"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kpRSCH7ALLcb6ucWM/say-not-complexity)
as a reminder that we're assuming something without understanding it.

When do we _need_ to use quantum computers to analyze solids?
Quantum computers are based on quantum mechanics, so we can intuit that materials
whose properties and behavior are so _quantum mechanical that we can't hope to
approximate them with classical methods_ will be good candidates for
demonstrating the usefulness of quantum computers.

But what solids fit this description?
From Griffiths' _Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_,

**Problem 1.21:** In general, quantum mechanics is relevant when the de Broglie
wavelength of the particle in question is greater than the characteristic
size of the system ($d$). In thermal equilibrium at (Kelvin) temperature $T$,
the average kinetic energy of a particle is
$$\frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T$$
(where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant $1.380 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{J \cdot 
K^{-1}}$), so the typical de Broglie wavelength ($\lambda = h / p$) is
$$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3m k_B T}}$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{J \cdot s}$.

  The purpose of this problem is to anticipate which systems will *have to be*
  treated quantum mechanically, and which can be safely described classically.{" "}

The lattice spacing in a typical **solid** is around $d=0.3 \mathrm{nm}$. Find
the temperature below which the free^1^ _electrons_ in a solid are quantum
mechanical. Below what temperature are the _nuclei_ in a solid quantum
mechanical? Use sodium as a typical case. _Moral_: The free electrons in a
solid are _always_ quantum mechanical; the nuclei are almost _never_ quantum
mechanical.

^1^In a solid the inner electrons are attached to a particular nucleus, and for
them the relevant distance would be the radius of the atom. But the outermost
electrons are not attached, and for them the relevant distance is the lattice
spacing. This problem pertains to _outer_ electrons.
